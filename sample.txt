How to Choose a Low-Mercury Fish: A Practical Guide

Fish is often praised as a healthy source of lean protein, packed with omega-3 fatty acids that support heart and brain health. But in recent years, concerns have grown about mercury—a toxic heavy metal that can build up in certain types of seafood. While not all fish are high in mercury, some popular varieties contain levels that may pose health risks, especially for young children, pregnant women, and nursing mothers.

For the average consumer, the question remains: How do you choose a fish that’s safe, nutritious, and low in mercury? The answer isn’t especially complicated, but it does require a little awareness and a few simple guidelines. Here’s what you need to know.

Understanding Mercury in Fish
Mercury enters the environment from both natural sources and human activity, like coal-burning power plants and industrial waste. In oceans, rivers, and lakes, it transforms into methylmercury, a more toxic form that accumulates in fish. This form of mercury tends to concentrate in large, long-living predatory fish—species that sit high on the food chain and consume many smaller fish over time.

These larger fish can end up with mercury levels millions of times higher than the surrounding water. When humans eat these fish regularly, mercury can accumulate in their bodies too. In high enough doses, mercury can damage the nervous system, especially in developing fetuses and young children.

Still, public health experts stress that seafood remains an important part of a balanced diet. The key is choosing varieties that are both rich in nutrients and low in mercury.

The Best Low-Mercury Choices
Some fish consistently test low in mercury. These tend to be smaller, shorter-lived species that don’t eat a lot of other fish. Here are some good options:

Salmon (wild-caught or farmed): One of the best choices for health and sustainability, salmon is high in omega-3s and very low in mercury.

Sardines: Small, oily, and inexpensive, sardines are packed with calcium and omega-3s, and have some of the lowest mercury levels among commonly eaten fish.

Anchovies: Similar to sardines, anchovies are tiny fish with very low mercury and high nutritional value.

Herring: A traditional staple in many parts of the world, herring is low in mercury and high in omega-3s.

Trout (especially freshwater): Another good option, trout tends to be low in mercury and widely available.

Tilapia: Mild-tasting and affordable, tilapia is low in mercury but not as high in omega-3s as fatty fish.

Catfish: A popular choice in southern U.S. cuisine, catfish is also low in mercury and widely farmed.

These fish are generally safe to eat a few times a week, even for those in sensitive populations like pregnant women or small children.

Fish to Limit or Avoid
On the other end of the spectrum are high-mercury species. These tend to be large predatory fish that live for many years and accumulate mercury over time. Here are some to watch out for:

Shark: High on the food chain, sharks often carry very high levels of mercury.

Swordfish: Another top predator, swordfish is among the highest in mercury and should be eaten only rarely.

King mackerel: Unlike its cousin, Atlantic mackerel (which is low in mercury), king mackerel has very high mercury levels.

Tilefish (from the Gulf of Mexico): This species contains enough mercury that the FDA recommends avoiding it altogether during pregnancy.

Bigeye tuna: While canned light tuna is generally safe, bigeye tuna—often served as sushi—is much higher in mercury.

Marlin: Like swordfish, marlin is a large, long-living fish with elevated mercury levels.

People in sensitive groups should avoid these fish entirely or limit their intake to very occasional meals—no more than once a month.

What About Tuna?
Tuna is one of the most consumed fish in the world, but its mercury content can vary. Canned light tuna, usually made from skipjack tuna, is relatively low in mercury and considered safe in moderate amounts—about two to three servings per week for adults, and one to two for children. Albacore (or white) tuna, however, has about three times more mercury than light tuna and should be eaten less frequently.

If you’re eating a lot of tuna—whether canned or fresh—it’s a good idea to mix it up with some lower-mercury fish like salmon or sardines.

How to Check Mercury Levels
There’s no need to memorize every fish species. Several helpful resources are available to guide your choices:

FDA and EPA Guidelines: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) jointly publish a list of best, good, and poor choices for fish based on mercury content.

Seafood Watch by Monterey Bay Aquarium: While focused more on sustainability, this guide also notes mercury concerns and provides recommendations for responsible seafood choices.

Mobile Apps: Apps like “FishWise” and “Seafood Watch” offer on-the-go guidance about mercury levels and sustainability.

When in doubt, choosing smaller fish or those lower on the food chain is a safe bet.

Balancing Safety and Nutrition
Experts agree that the benefits of eating fish usually outweigh the risks, as long as you’re selective. Fish is a valuable source of protein, vitamin D, and essential fatty acids, and most people don’t eat enough of it. Mercury becomes a concern mainly when people eat large amounts of high-mercury fish over extended periods.

To strike the right balance, consider these basic tips:

Eat a variety of fish. Don’t rely too heavily on one type of fish. Rotate between low-mercury species like salmon, sardines, and trout.

Follow portion guidelines. For adults, two to three 4-ounce servings of low-mercury fish per week is a healthy target. For children, portions should be smaller, based on age and weight.

Be cautious with raw fish. Sushi and sashimi often feature high-mercury species like tuna and swordfish. Opt for options with salmon or shrimp instead.

Ask questions. When dining out, don’t hesitate to ask what kind of fish is being served, how it was caught, and whether it’s a low-mercury variety.

Conclusion
Choosing a low-mercury fish doesn’t require a degree in marine biology. With a little awareness, consumers can make safe, healthy choices that support both their bodies and the environment. Sticking with smaller fish, checking reliable guides, and enjoying seafood in moderation are all practical steps.

In an era where food safety and sustainability often collide, the good news is that there are plenty of delicious, nutritious, and low-mercury options on the menu.
